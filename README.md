# aoc21

Advent of code solutions 2021.

The automation in `src/aoc_helper` is based on the work of **@salt-die**,
[here](https://github.com/salt-die/Advent-of-Code).

## Installation

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, eg. `python3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Get the session token cookie from the advent of code website (using whatever tools your browser
provides to inspect cookies). Place that in `src/aoc_helper/.token`.

Once installed, you can use `python3.10 -m src --help` to see the available options.
